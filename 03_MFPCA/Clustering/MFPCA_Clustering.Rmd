## Exploratory Analysis: Clustering of MFPCA scores 

***

## Clustering
In order to group the curves into clusters, the first 10 PC scores are clustered by a k-means algorithm. In order to evaluate an appropriate number of clusters, Figure 1 shows an elbow plot for $k \in \{1,...,10\}$:

![**Figure 1:** Elbow plot for k-means clustering for $k \in \{1,...,10\}$. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/MFPCA/Clusters/png/elbow_plot_1.png)

***

The elbow plot would indicate an elbow at $k=2$. However, given the data structure with four scenarios, in the following, $k=4$ is chosen. The four clusters are rather unbalanced and dominated by two large clusters, namely clusters 3 and 4, as the following table indicates:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
setwd("/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit")
source("Scripts/MA_FDA_veg/01_Description/utils.R")
library(knitr)
scenarios = c("picontrol", "ssp126", "ssp370", "ssp585")

df = as.data.frame(rbind("Cluster 1" = c(47,177,204,224, 652), "Cluster 2" = c(83,50,55,49,237), "Cluster 3" = c(68,46,58,65,237), "Cluster 4" = c(236,169,145,127,677), "Sum" = c(434,442,462,465, 1803)))
colnames(df) = c(long_names_scenarios(scenarios), "Sum")
kable(df, caption = "Number of curves in each cluster after 126 years of recovery")
```

In order to get a first impression of the cluster-specific PFT-behavior, Figure 2 shows the PFT-wise mean shares of above ground carbon over the first 100 years of recovery. Note that here, the clusters are derived using the whole time span of 126 years of recovery and all scenarios are combined.

Figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of the clusters:

### Cluster development over time

Theory in science of vegetation states that the vegetation composition after disturbance is already set only shortly after the disturbance. This would mean in statistical terms, that the cluster assignment should be rather similar no matter how many years of recovery after disturbance are considered. Figure 4 shows the cluster assignments for all four scenarios over different years after disturbance:

***

We can clearly see that the final composition of clusters is already (nearly) reached after about 60 years depending on the scenario. Drastic changes are especially in the first 20 years and the clusters quickly stabilize in their core grid cells.


Figure 5 shows the corresponding Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) values, an indicator, how much clusters coincide:

In order to further investigate these patterns, Figure 6 shows the temporal clustering using the respective year only, i.e. not the whole trajectory until the respective year, but the PC scores derived for that year only.

Figure 7 shows again the corresponding ARI values, here for the separate scenarios and all of them combined:

### Soil properties

Figure 8 shows some soil properties per cluster and scenario.
