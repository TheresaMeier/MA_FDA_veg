## Exploratory Analysis: MFPCA for patches disturbed between 2015 and 2040 for all scenarios together

***
**General questions before the start:** 

- So far, we only considered grid cells disturbed between 2015 and 2040. Should we do the same analysis for a later time point? Or e.g. one time period before the experiment starts (e.g. 1990 to 2015) and one time period afterwards (e.g. 2100 to 2125)?
- So far, we only considered one patch due to run time and data handling in general. Should I conduct the analysis for multiple patches and compare? Or even find a method to combine the results for multiple patches? (Like e.g. Bonferroni for multiple effect estimates.)

***

In order to consider the multivariate data structure at hand when running a FPCA, a multivariate FPCA (MFPCA) is conducted using the R-package `MFPCA`. Now, a single `multiFunData` object is created which consists of one `funData` object (package `funData`) which is  three-dimensional: the first dimension represents the grid cells. We have 434, 442, 462 and 465 disturbed grid cells in scenarios *Control*, *SSP1-RCP2.6*, *SSP3-RCP7.0* and *SSP5-RCP8.5*, respectively. This adds up to 1803 grid cells in total. The second dimension represents the *Year after Disturbance* and the third one the *PFT*, numbered from 1 to 5. Since we are looking at four independent runs of the vegetation model LPJ-GUESS, the grid cells disturbed in each scenario may vary or may coincide. In total, 1577 unique grid cells are disturbed, where 226 of them are disturbed in at least two scenarios. 

The MFPCA is conducted with 10 principal components in order to be consistend with the univariate FPCAs conducted before for each scenario and PFT. Note that the `MFPCA` package does not provide an implementation of reconstructing the initial curves for multi-dimensional data.

**Questions here:** Is there a mathematical or computational reason, why this is not implemented? Would it be worth the effort to implement it myself?

In the following, we are going to see the principal components, now as heatmaps, a plot visualizing the first two principal components and the results of a 4-means clustering.

***

## Principal Components

As a first step, let's take a look at the principal components themselves. The following table shows the variability in per cent that the first 10 principal components account for in each scenario:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
setwd("/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit")
source("Scripts/MA_FDA_veg/01_Description/utils.R")
library(knitr)
scenarios = c("picontrol", "ssp126", "ssp370", "ssp585")

df = as.data.frame(t(cbind("Variability" = c(91.22, 7.49, 0.52, 0.33, 0.21, 0.10, 0.06, 0.04, 0.01, 0.01))))
colnames(df) = c("PC 1", "PC 2","PC 3","PC 4","PC 5","PC 6","PC 7","PC 8","PC 9","PC 10")
kable(df)
```
Note that this time, the values truly represent the accounted variation, not only the relative part. Obviously, the first principal component already captures nearly all of the variability in the data. The screeplot depicted in Figure 1 underlines this result:

![**Figure 1:** Screeplot of the MFPCA. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/screeplot_1.png)

***

In order to investigate changes in the values of the first 10 principal components, the following Figure 2 shows how positive (first plot) and negative deviations (second plot) to the mean act on the PC scores. Note that these plots only cover differences, not the mean itself. Values smaller than the mean are displayed in different shades of blue, while values above the mean are displayed in red.

![**Figure 2:** First 10 principal components. Here, the y-axis represents *PFTs* (*Tundra* (1), *Needleleaf Evergreen* (2), *Pioneering Broadlef* (3), *other Conifers* (4) and *Temperate Broadleaf* (5)), and the x-axis the *Year after Disturbance*. The first row of each PC indicates positive deviations to the mean while the second row visualizes negative deviations to the mean. Note that these plots only cover differences, not the mean itself.  ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/PCs/PCs_PC10.png)

***

The interpretation for the first PC might be the following:

- For PFT *Tundra* (1), higher values in the first PC indicate higher scores than the mean in the first 28 years after disturbance and slightly lower values in the years after. Lower values represent the opposite. Note that only in the first years, where the peak in *Tundra* appears, the deviation is more pronounced.
- For PFT *Needleleaf Evergreen* (2), up to 19 years after disturbance, higher values mean higher scores and vice versa. After that period, high values indicate lower scores, and these dynamics are enforced with increasing year. Small values represent the opposite.
- For PFT *Pioneering Broadleaf* (3), higher PC 1 values indicate higher scores than the mean, and this difference is increasing with time passing. Again, vice versa for lower values.
- For PFT *other Conifers* (4), the effects are rather small in comparison to the other PFTs. Up to about 40 years after disturbance, high values of PC 1 indicate a slightly higher score, and afterwards a slightly lower score (and vice versa for lower values).
- For PFT *Temperate Broadleaf* (5), higher and lower values in the first PC lead to only small changes of the PC score. Again, variation in *Temperate Broadleaf* may not be as relevant as other PFTs.

So in total, high values in the first component indicate a lower share of *Needleleaf Evergreen*, a higher share of *Pioneering Broadleaf* and a higher share of *Tundra* in the beginning of the study period than the mean. *Other Conifers* and *Temperate Broadleaf* do not substantially contribute to the dynamics.

## Clustering
In order to group the curves into clusters, the first 10 PC scores are clustered by a k-means algorithm. In order to evaluate an appropriate number of clusters, Figure 3 shows an elbow plot for $k \in \{1,...,10\}$:

![**Figure 3:** Elbow plot for k-means clustering for $k \in \{1,...,10\}$. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/elbow_plot_1.png)

***

The elbow plot would indicate an elbow at $k=2$. However, given the data structure with four scenarios, in the following, $k=4$ is chosen. The four clusters are rather unbalanced and dominated by two large clusters, namely clusters 3 and 4, as the following table indicates:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
setwd("/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit")
source("Scripts/MA_FDA_veg/01_Description/utils.R")
library(knitr)
scenarios = c("picontrol", "ssp126", "ssp370", "ssp585")

df = as.data.frame(rbind("Cluster 1" = c(76,46, 56,67, 245), "Cluster 2" = c(75,54,63,47, 239), "Cluster 3" = c(231,166,142,126, 665), "Cluster 4" = c(52,176,201,225, 654), "Sum" = c(434,442,462,465, 1803)))
colnames(df) = c(long_names_scenarios(scenarios), "Sum")
kable(df, caption = "Number of curves in each cluster after 126 years of recovery")
```

***

In order to get a first impression of the cluster-specific PFT-behavior, Figure 4 shows the PFT-wise mean shares of above ground carbon over the first 100 years of recovery. Note that here, the clusters are derived using the whole time span of 126 years of recovery and all scenarios are combined.

***

![**Figure 4:** PFT-wise mean shares of above ground carbon over time. Note that the values are averages over locations and clusters. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/cluster_means_per_PFT_1.png)

***

The plot indicates that cluster 1 is mainly driven by *Temperate Broadleaf*, while *Pioneering Broadleaf* is the dominant species in clusters 2 and 4. These clusters differ in terms of other PFTs: in cluster 4, after about 60 years of recovery, hardly anything but *Pioneering Broadleaf* is present, whereas in cluster 2, other needleleafed trees are present as well. Cluster 3 is dominated by *Needleleaf Evergreen*, followed by *Conifers (others)*. Note that *Tundra* does not play an important role here.

### Cluster development over time

Theory in science of vegetation states that the vegetation composition after disturbance is already set only shortly after the disturbance. This would mean in statistical terms, that the cluster assignment should be rather similar no matter how many years of recovery after disturbance are considered. Figure 5 shows the cluster assignments for all four scenarios over different years after disturbance:

***

![**Figure 5:** Cluster composition over years after disturbance for all four scenarios. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/clusters_with_years_1.png)

***

We can clearly see that the final composition of clusters is already (nearly) reached after about 60 years depending on the scenario. Drastic changes are especially in the first 20 years and the clusters quickly stabilize in their core grid cells.

Note that Lucia could not detect these patterns in her clustering, so she assumed that this mechanism is probably not covered by the simulation model LPJ-GUESS. This result here however could be an indication for that phenomenon in the simulation.

In order to further investigate these patterns, Figure 6 shows the cluster-wise means after different time spans of vegetation. Here, the clusters after 5, 10, 20, ..., 120, 126 years are taken and evaluated by their mean share of above ground carbon over grid cells and clusters. This means in particular that in each considered time step, the cluster assignment could be changed (in contrast to Figure 4).

***

![**Figure 6:** Cluster-wise mean shares of above ground carbon over different time spans. Note that the values are averages over locations and clusters. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/cluster_means_with_years_1.png)

***

We can see that (depending on the PFT), the dominance of specific PFTs establishes after only a few decades.

**Possible next steps:** Further investigate the clusters, also considering climate data: are there any thresholds that define the clusters precisely (e.g. above a certain temperature, we are in cluster 4)?

### PC 1 vs. PC 2

Figure 7 shows the first two principal components plotted against each other. The colors in the left plot visualize the clusters, while in the right plot, they indicate the scenario.


![**Figure 7:** PC 1 vs. PC 2 for the MFPCA for grid cells which are disturbed in one scenario only. The left plot shows the resulting clusters using a 4-means clustering algorithm, the right plot shows the scenarios. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/PC1vsPC2/PC1_vs_PC2_1_scenarios_clustered_all.png)

***

We can see that the clusters found are clearly distinguishable by the first two PCs and that the clusters derived by 4-means find patterns which are beyond the partitioning into scenarios.

### Clustered curves per PFT and scenario

Next, to further investigate the cluster assignment, in the following, the clusters are displayed for each PFT and scenario separately. Let's start with *Tundra*.

#### Tundra

Figure 8 shows the four clusters for scenario *Control*. Cluster 3 represents the largest cluster with nearly half of the grid cells inside. Cluster 1 covers those curves with a less steep decrease in above ground carbon. Cluster 2 and 4 are rather similar.

***

![**Figure 8:** Clustered curves for scenario *Control* and PFT *Tundra*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_picontrol_Tundra_1.png)

***

Next, Figure 9 shows the equivalent plot for scenario *SSP1-RCP2.6*. Here, the two dominating clusters 3 and 4 are rather similar, while clusters 1 and 2 cover all grid cells with a (second) peak after 60 years of regeneration.

***

![**Figure 9:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP1-RCP2.6* and PFT *Tundra*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions.  ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp126_Tundra_1.png)

***

Figure 10 (scenario *SSP3-RCP7.0*) shows a similar pattern: there are no substantial differences between the clusters.

***

![**Figure 10:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP3-RCP7.0* and PFT *Tundra*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp370_Tundra_1.png)


***
Finally, Figure 11 shows the clustered curves for the most drastic scenario *SSP5-RCP8.5*. Again, no clear differences are visible by visual inspection.

***

![**Figure 11:**  Clustered curves for scenario *SSP5-RCP8.5* and PFT *Tundra*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp585_Tundra_1.png)

***
  
In total, PFT *Tundra* seems not to be dominant for cluster building.

***

#### *Needleleaf Evergreen*
  
Second, let's take a look at PFT *Needleleaf Evergreen*. Figure 12 shows the clustered curves for scenario *Control*:

***
  ![**Figure 12:** Clustered curves for scenario *Control* and PFT *Needleleaf Evergreen*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_picontrol_BNE_1.png)

***
  
Here, some obvious patterns are detected by the clustering: while clusters 1 and 2 cover mostly mediate shares of above ground carbon, cluster 3, the dominant cluster, represents grid cells with a rather high share. Cluster 4 on the other hand represents those curves with a small peak in the beginning and a rather low share in general.

Figure 13 shows the equivalent plot for scenario *SSP1-RCP2.6*:

***

  ![**Figure 13:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP1-RCP2.6* and PFT *Needleleaf Evergreen*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp126_BNE_1.png)

***

Here, the same patterns as for the *Control* scenario become apparent: the two dominant clusters 3 and 4 represent very high and very low shares of above ground carbon, respectively, while cluster 1 and 2 cover mediate shares. Note that in contrast to before, now, we have two dominant clusters. 

***

  ![**Figure 14:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP3-RCP7.0* and PFT *Needleleaf Evergreen*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions.  ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp370_BNE_1.png)

***

Figure 14 and Figure 15 visualize the clustering for scenarios *SSP3-RCP7.0* and *SSP5-RCP8.5*, respectively. Again, the same dynamics as for the first warming scenario are present in the data.

***
  
  ![**Figure 15:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP5-RCP8.5* and PFT *Needleleaf Evergreen*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions.  ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp585_BNE_1.png)
  
***

In total, clusters 1 and 2 are mainly driven by mediate shares of above ground carbon of *Needleleaf Evergreen*, while clusters 3 and 4 mainly reflect rather high and low shares, respectively. Therefore, PFT *Needleleaf Evergreen* seems to be an important component in the clustering process.

***

#### *Pioneering Broadleaf*

Figure 16 shows the clustered curves for scenario *Control* and PFT *Pioneering Broadleaf*. 

***
  
  ![**Figure 16:** Clustered curves for scenario *Control* and PFT *Pioneering Broadleaf*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_picontrol_IBS_1.png)

***

Here, clusters 1 and 3 represent rather low shares of above ground carbon, while clusters 2 and 4 cover higher shares. Note that clusters 2 and 4 differ in the increase dynamic, i.e. the increase in share in cluster 4 is more steep and with a higher peak on average than in cluster 2. Cluster 3 is the dominant cluster.

Figure 17 shows the equivalent plot for scenario *SSP1-RCP2.6*:

***

  ![**Figure 17:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP1-RCP2.6* and PFT *Pioneering Broadleaf*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp126_IBS_1.png)

***

The two dominant clusters 3 and 4 represent mostly very low and very high shares in above ground carbon, respectively. The two remaining clusters, clusters 1 and 2, cover moderate low and moderate high shares, respectively.

***
  
  ![**Figure 18:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP3-RCP7.0* and PFT *Pioneering Broadleaf*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions.  ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp370_IBS_1.png)

***

Figure 18 and 19 show the dynamics for scenarios *SSP3-RCP7.0* and *SSP5-RCP8.5*, respectively. Again, similar patterns are obvious, but with an interior dynamic: the more the temperature rises, the less clear the clustering. For example, cluster 3, which represents mainly rather low shares, tend to have more and more curves with higher shares. The pattern in cluster 2, i.e. the behavior in increasing changes and becomes less uniform.

***
  
  ![**Figure 19:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP5-RCP8.5* and PFT *Pioneering Broadleaf*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions.   ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp585_IBS_1.png)

***

In total, *Pioneering Broadleaf* seems to be a major driver of cluster building.

***
  
#### *Conifers (others)*

Figure 20 shows the clustering dynamics for scenario *Control* and PFT *Conifers (others)*. Some minor differences are present: while the dominating cluster 3 and cluster 2 mainly cover grid cells with a high share of above ground carbon, clusters 1 and 4 represent those cells with a maily lower share. Nite that the dynamics in these clusters differ in terms of the increase and timing of the peak.

***

  ![**Figure 20:** Clustered curves for scenario *Control* and PFT *Conifers (others)*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_picontrol_otherC_1.png)

***

Figure 21 shows the equivalent plot for scenario *SSP1-RCP2.6*. Now, the two dominant clusters 3 and 4 cover mainly grid cells with a high and low share of above ground carbon, respectively, while clusters 1 and 2 cover the mediate shares.
 
***
  
  ![**Figure 21:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP1-RCP2.6* and PFT *Conifers (others)*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions.  ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp126_otherC_1.png)

***
  
Figure 22 and Figure 23 show the same dynamics for scenarios *SSP3-RCP7.0* and *SSP5-RCP8.5*, respectively. The dominating clusters 3 and 4 represent high and low shares of above ground carbon, while the two remaining clusters cover mediate shares.

***

  ![**Figure 22:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP3-RCP7.0* and PFT *Conifers (others)*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions.  ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp370_otherC_1.png)


***
  
  ![**Figure 23:** Clustered curves for scenario *SSP5-RCP8.5* and PFT *Conifers (others)*. The colored curves indicate the belonging to the respective cluster. The dark curves represent the cluster-specific mean functions.   ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp585_otherC_1.png)
  
***

In summary, PFT *Conifers (others)* seems to mainly affect clusters 3 and 4, but is a minor factor in clustering in general.

***
  
#### *Temperate Broadleaf*
  
Lastly, let's take a look at PFT *Temperate Broadleaf*. Figure 24 shows the clustered curves for scenario *Control*:

***

  ![**Figure 24:** *Temperate Broadleaf* - Control. ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_picontrol_TeBS_1.png)

***

In the *Control* scenario, only a few grid cells have a non-zero share of above ground carbon. Due to this lack of data, the clustering should not be overrated.

***
  
  ![**Figure 25:** *Temperate Broadleaf* - SSP1-RCP2.6 ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp126_TeBS_1.png)

***

Figure 25 shows the equivalent plot for scenario *SSP1-RCP2.6*. Clearly, some dependencies are apparent: clusters 1 and 2 comprise of almost all of the non-zero curves, but reflect both a different dynamic in the increase.

***
  
  ![**Figure 26:** *Temperate Broadleaf* - SSP3-RCP7.0 ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp370_TeBS_1.png)

***

With increase in temperature, *Temperate Broadleaf* becomes more and more important. This is also visible in Figure 24, where the clustered curves for scenario *SSP3-RCP7.0* are displayed. In all four clusters there are a couple of non-zero curves, with most of them being in cluster 1, the smallest cluster.

***

  ![**Figure 27:** *Temperate Broadleaf* - SSP5-RCP8.5 ](/home/theresa/Schreibtisch/Theresa/STUDIUM/Master Statistics and Data Science/Masterarbeit/Scripts/Plots/FPCA/PCs_2015_2040/MFPCA/mfpca_all/png/clusters/Cluster_4-means_ssp585_TeBS_1.png)
  
***

A similar pattern is apparent in the data for scenario *SSP5-RCP8.5* depicted in Figure 27. Cluster 1 is the only cluster with representing some dynamic in the curves.

In total, PFT *Temperate Broadleaf* hardly affects the clustering algorithm.

## Summary of the Results

To conclude and bring together all the results, here, the effects of the PFTs on the clusters are summarized for each scenario.

**Control:**

- **Cluster 1:** is driven by high shares of *Tundra* and *Conifers (others)*, by moderate shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and by low shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf*.

- **Cluster 2:** is driven by high shares of *other Conifers*, moderate shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *Tundra* and of low shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf*.

- **Cluster 3:** is driven by high shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *other Conifers*, by moderate shares of *Tundra* and low shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf*.

- **Cluster 4:** is driven by high shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf*, by moderate shares of *Tundra*, and by low shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *other Conifers*.

**SSP1-RCP2.6:**

- **Cluster 1:** is driven by high shares of *Temperate Broadleaf* and by moderate shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen*, *other Conifers*, *Tundra* and *Pioneering Broadleaf*.

- **Cluster 2:** is driven by high shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf* and moderate shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen*, *Tundra* and *other Conifers*.

- **Cluster 3:** is driven by high shares of *other Conifers* and *Needleleaf Evergreen*, moderate shares of *Tundra* and low shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf.

- **Cluster 4:** is driven by high shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf* and low shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *other Conifers*.

**SSP3-RCP7.0:**

- **Cluster 1:** is driven by high shares of *Temperate Broadleaf* and moderate shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen*, *Pioneering Broadleaf* and *other Conifers*.

- **Cluster 2:** is driven by high shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf* and moderate shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *other Conifers*.

- **Cluster 3:** is driven by high shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *other Conifers* and by low shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf*.

- **Cluster 4:** is driven by high shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf* and by lows shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *other Conifers*.

**SSP5-RCP8.5:**

- **Cluster 1:** is driven by high shares of *Temperate Broadleaf*, moderate shares of *other Conifers* and *Pioneering Broadleaf* and *Needleleaf Evergreen*.

- **Cluster 2:** is driven by high shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf* and mediate shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *other Conifers*.

- **Cluster 3:** is driven by high shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *other Conifers* and by low shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf*.

- **Cluster 4:** is driven by high shares of *Pioneering Broadleaf* and lows shares of *Needleleaf Evergreen* and *other Conifers*.
